# cweb
A very minimal web server
This is a hobby project. I just wanted to write a simple web server to see
how web server works.
cweb has a size limitation of 5M for files and it has a lot of bugs,
memory errors and memory leaks because i didn't want to spend too
much time on it i just wanted to make it work.

# Usage
Compile cweb using make command and place the cweb binary in the same directory
as your website directory and then execute cweb
